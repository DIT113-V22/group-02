# Pocket Parking - Go Park Yourself! 🅿️🅿️
**What is Pocket Parking?**  
Pocket Parking is an automated parking service for drivers. Our solution aims to reduce car accidents that frequently occur in parking lots. Our goal is also to introduce digitalized personal valet parking, that everyone can afford, right in your pocket!

**Why is Pocket Parking necessary?**  
> "20 percent of car accidents happen in parking lots" - [MotorBiscuit](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/an-alarming-number-of-car-accidents-happen-in-parking-lots/)  

Pocket Parking aims to reduce driver accidents within parking lots by taking an automated approach to the problem. Driverless parking is not only safer, it is also quite efficient and time saving.

**How does Pocket Parking work?**  
Pocket Parking will use the car's sensors to detect obstacles and avoid collisions, find available parking spaces and find secure paths to drive through in search of parking. It will detect presence of pedestrians and make decisions on how to keep distance to avoid harming them.

# Software Architecture
**Communication**
In order to develop our system solution we needed to establish communication between the smartcar and mobile application. For this reason we specifically chose MQTT which is one of the more simple brokers to implement and work with. MQTT stands for "Message Queuing Telemetry Transport" and it's a protocol for devices from which they can publish/subscribe messages in order to communicate with other components within the system. MQTT is technically implemented in the smartcar and mobile application via C++ and Java code in the files below which is described further.
